            <p>In the ornamental fish industry, a genetically modified variety of the black widow tetra. Stunning and sparkling red, blue, yellow, green, pink, orange, and purple bodied colour variations of this tetra have been developed through gene transfer or transgenic technology. The fish glow when kept under blue LED lights, hence the name ‘glowfish’. Maintenance of these brightly coloured and reasonably priced fish in small and medium-sized aquariums at home, the office, hotels, and other settings has become popular.</p>
