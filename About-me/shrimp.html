            <p>Dwarf shrimp are kept almost all over the world by a wide variety of people. In the beginning, there were only a few species in the trade, which were mostly transparent or inconspicuously colored black or brown, but today, on the other hand, you can find more than 100 different species and varieties of dwarf shrimp for freshwater aquariums in shrimp stores.</p>
